# Phasing Structural Variants Using Phased Aligned Data - BioAI Hackathon Team

## üî¨ Project Objective

We aim to create a state-of-the-art pipeline to **phase structural variants (SVs) in human genomes** using **phased aligned data**. Unlike traditional SV calling pipelines, we focus purely on **assigning haplotypes to pre-detected SVs** by leveraging phased SNPs and phased BAM alignments. Our workflow introduces a novel algorithm for SV-to-haplotype assignment with optional machine learning support for ambiguous cases.

## üìÖ Pipeline Overview

**Note:** We do not detect SVs. We phase existing SVs using phased BAM + phased SNPs.

**Workflow Image:** Refer to ![Phasing SV Pipeline](./Pipeline_Diagram.png) in the repo for full visual overview.

### Input Requirements

* BAM must be phased (HP tags assigned)
* Phased SNP VCF must be available
* SV VCF must be pre-detected by external tools

### Step 1: Input Validation and Preparation

* Ensure BAM has HP tags (`HP:i:1`, `HP:i:2`)
* Ensure SNP VCF and SV VCF are indexed and correspond to the same genome build

### Step 2: SV Haplotype Assignment (Novel Method)

* Extract reads supporting each SV from the phased BAM
* Assign SVs to haplotypes using following conditions:

  1. SV-supporting reads must overlap phased SNPs
  2. Assign SV to haplotype 1 or 2 based on majority of HP-tagged reads
  3. Apply minimum read support threshold (user-defined)
  4. If equal number of reads support both haplotypes, assign both or mark as ambiguous

### Step 3: Output Generation

* Create phased SV VCF file with GT and PS fields for haplotype annotation
* Merge phased SNPs and phased SVs using bcftools if required

Example:

```bash
bcftools merge whatshap_phased.vcf.gz HG00733_SVs_phased.vcf -o merged_output.vcf
```

### Step 4: Visualization & Reporting

* Visualize phased SVs in IGV or circos
* Generate key metrics:

  * Percentage of SVs phased
  * SV type distribution per haplotype
  * Concordance with SNP phased blocks

---

## üõ†Ô∏è View of Output

* Final VCF with phased SVs annotated with `HP`, `GT`, and `PS` fields
* Summary report file with:

  * Total SVs processed
  * Phased vs unphased SVs
  * Ambiguous SVs list

---

## üéØ Optional Enhancements

* Machine learning model to resolve ambiguous SV phasing
* Add support for trio-aware SV phasing using family datasets
* Integration with Hi-C or Strand-seq data for long-range phasing improvements
* Scalability improvements for large cohort studies

---

## üìÜ Future Tasks

* Finalize core `link_sv_to_hp.py` algorithm
* Integrate quality filtering module for low-confidence SVs
* Validate pipeline on trio ground-truth datasets
* Benchmark against existing methods
* Prepare final dataset + documentation for GitHub release
