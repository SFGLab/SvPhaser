# Code of Conduct

> Short version: **Be respectful, be inclusive, be constructive.** We’re here to build useful software and a healthy community around it.

## Our Pledge

We as maintainers, contributors, and users pledge to make participation in this project a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Positive behaviors

* Demonstrate empathy and kindness to other people.
* Respect different opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback.
* Focus on what is best for the community and project in the long term.
* Use welcoming and inclusive language.

### Unacceptable behaviors

* Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form.
* Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome sexual attention.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment, doxxing, or publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.
* Sustained disruption of conversations, issues, PRs, or meetings.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. They may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (GitHub issues, PRs, discussions, code review, docs, chats) and applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it to the maintainers:

* **Primary contact:** <INSERT-CONTACT-EMAIL>
* **Backup contact:** <INSERT-ALTERNATE-EMAIL>

Reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. We will respect the reporter’s privacy and handle confidential information responsibly.

## Enforcement Guidelines

When a violation is confirmed, maintainers may use these guidelines to determine consequences:

1. **Correction**
   *Impact:* Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.
   *Consequence:* A private, written warning with clear guidance on expected behavior.

2. **Warning**
   *Impact:* A single incident or series of actions with a wider negative impact.
   *Consequence:* A warning and temporary limitations on participation (e.g., muted in discussions, PRs limited) for a period determined by maintainers.

3. **Temporary Ban**
   *Impact:* A serious violation of community standards or continued inappropriate behavior after warnings.
   *Consequence:* Temporary ban from all project spaces and interactions.

4. **Permanent Ban**
   *Impact:* Demonstrating a pattern of violation or behavior that poses a safety threat.
   *Consequence:* Permanent ban from all project spaces.

Maintainers will document enforcement actions and aim for consistency and proportionality.

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was made in error, you may appeal by contacting the maintainers with a concise explanation. Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers not involved in the original decision when possible.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from community best practices and is inspired by the principles of the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).
